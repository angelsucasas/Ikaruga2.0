SYNOPSIS 
Features

should contain a minimal example of use (perhaps as little as one line of code; skip the unusual use cases or anything not needed by most users); the DESCRIPTION should describe your module in broad terms, generally in just a few paragraphs; more detail of the module's routines or methods, lengthy code examples, or other in-depth material should be given in subsequent sections.

Ideally, someone who's slightly familiar with your module should be able to refresh their memory without hitting "page down". As your reader continues through the document, they should receive a progressively greater amount of knowledge. -- from perlmodstyle

Name -- self-explanatory names are best. collide-2d-aabb-aabb sounds promising, though it assumes I know what an "aabb" is. If the name sounds too vague or unrelated, it may be a signal to move on.

One-liner -- having a one-liner that describes the module is useful for getting an idea of what the module does in slightly greater detail. collide-2d-aabb-aabb says it

Determines whether a moving axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collides with other AABBs.

Awesome: it defines what an AABB is, and what the module does. Now to gauge how well it'd fit into my code:

Usage -- rather than starting to delve into the API docs, it'd be great to see what the module looks like in action. I can quickly determine whether the example JS fits the desired style and problem. People have lots of opinions on things like promises/callbacks and ES6. If it does fit the bill, then I can proceed to greater detail.

API -- the name, description, and usage of this module all sound appealing to me. I'm very likely to use this module at this point. I just need to scan the API to make sure it does exactly what I need and that it will integrate easily into my codebase. The API section ought to detail the module's objects and functions, their signatures, return types, callbacks, and events in detail. Types should be included where they aren't obvious. Caveats should be made clear.

Installation -- if I've read this far down, then I'm sold on trying out the module. If there are nonstandard installation notes, here's where they'd go, but even if it's just a regular npm install, I'd like to see that mentioned, too. New users start using Node all the time, so having a link to npmjs.org and an install command provides them the resources to figure out how Node modules work.

License -- most modules put this at the very bottom, but this might actually be better to have higher up; you're likely to exclude a module VERY quickly if it has a license incompatible with your work. I generally stick to the MIT/BSD/X11/ISC flavours. If you have a non-permissive license, stick it at the very top of the module to prevent any confusion.
